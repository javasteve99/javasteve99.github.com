	<p>Celebrate The Work was an internal project I worked on at Vistaprint. Copywriter <a href="mailto:jen.writing@gmail.com">Jen Burk</a> and I were tasked with creating a website to be shown to other departments highlighting the work that the creative team had done on a new product launch as a way of "advertising" ourselves within the company. Over the course of one weekend we conceived, wrote, designed and developed the site.</p>
	<p>It is a simple, one-page site that uses jQuery to bring the user through a slideshow demonstrating the various pieces created by the team for the product launch. If a user has javascript disabled then all the work will display on the same page and the navigation arrows will not be present. I wrote the jQuery script for the slideshow, and software developer <a href="mailto:derekdahmer@gmail.com">Derek Dahmer</a> (<a href="http://www.derekdahmer.com/" target="_blank">website</a>) assisted me with the part of the script that removes the back arrow on the first slide and the forward arrow on the last slide.</p>
	<p>The site is no longer live, as it was intended to be taken down within a few weeks of being presented to the company. The domain name is reserved so we can use it for similar projects in the future.</p>
