	<p>For this project I redesigned the table of contents from an issue of Baseline Magazine, using content from an actual issue plus some additional content from another class project. My struggle with this project was to try and break out of the comfortable constraints I had built for myself in previous projects with the use of heavily detailed and intensely confining grids.</p>
