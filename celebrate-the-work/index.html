        <p>Bubbling with copywriters, designers, project managers and strategists, it's the marketing team's job to <em>share Vistaprint with the world</em> every day. We anticipate needs. We turn big ideas into more business. We transform sketches into sales. We use tactics to drive more traffic. And we do it because <em>we care about our customers and know that we can make their lives better</em>.</p>
        <p>Of course, things move fast at Vistaprint. It's easy to miss what's happening next door, let alone in another department. That's why we've brought you here and why <em>we're tearing down the cube walls</em>. Now you can see all of the <em>incredible creative</em> that's been right around the corner, but out of sight.</p>
        <p>So,  take a second and check out the <em>strategy, style and swagger</em> that has driven our <strong>Embroidery Campaign</strong>. Click the right arrow to start.</p>

        <span class="leadline2">WANT TO GET A HEAD START</span><p>
        <p>We wanted to build the anticipation and get everyone excited about the launch.</p>
        <p>To do this, we added a banner to the bottom of retention emails so customers could sign up for embroidery-specific offers. 
</p>
		<p>Then, the countdown began.</p>

        <span class="leadline2">WANT TO STAY ON TOP OF THE COMPETITION</span></p>
        <p>You can't just set up a business -- you need to set it apart. The competition will be biting at your heels unless you show customers you're ahead of the game.</p>
        <p>In this game, there's only one winner. We're waving them in.</p>

        <p>Looking professional doesn't have to empty their pockets. That's what this email is all about.</p>
        <p>We're helping our customers stand taller than the competition with higher quality apparel at incredibly low prices.</p>

        <span class="leadline2">ARE NOT ONLY HERE TO PLAY BUT HERE TO STAY</span></p>
        <p>From the day they launched their business, they've given it 110%. That drive and determination stems from a passion that not everyone can relate to.</p>
        <p>These banner ads show business owners that we know who they are and what they want. They want to win. Luckily we've got just the thing to take them to the next level -- at a really great price.</p>

        <p>Even small startups should be able to run with the big boys. To do this, they've got to have the look -- the embroidered look.</p>
        <p>We're taking full advantage of our Facebook page and putting our embroidery on display for all to see. We want customers to see  that it's all about the details -- and we never miss a stitch.</p>
