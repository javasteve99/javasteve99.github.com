      <p>The owner of Falmouth Chimney Sweep, requested that I put together a simple redesign of his existing site. The old site was cluttered, had an unclear hierarchy and used very poor code.</p>
      <p>I updated all the code for his site to be standards-compliant and to improve his search ranking. Because the site is so heavy on content I focused on trimming the existing content down, and creating a clear and readable typographic hierarchy. Because he runs a small business in a small community I decided to focus the site around promoting him as a trustworthy, dependable member of the local community.</p>
