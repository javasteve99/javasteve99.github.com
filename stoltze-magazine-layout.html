  <p>For this assigment I had to choose a current graphic designer/typographer, find an article about their work and then create two spreads in a magazine around them, using their style and words as inspiration for the layout. I chose Clif Stoltze, a designer who runs a studio in Boston.</p>
  <p>Stoltze&rsquo;s work focuses a lot on music, so I chose design elements that were based on music somehow. The guitar image has the same proportion as a CD cover. The extreme rag in the paragraph text on page 2 is meant to mimic the rise and fall of musical frequencies on a stereo equalizer.</p>
