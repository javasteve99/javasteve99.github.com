      <p>For 3 years I was a co-host of <a href="http://www.freshtilledsoil.com/category/podcast/">The Dirt</a>, a UX podcast. In that time <a href="http://csskarma.com/">Tim Wright</a>, <a href="http://www.markgrambau.com/">Mark Grambau</a> and I recorded 166 episodes, spoke with dozens of industry leaders and a few of my personal heroes, and <del>wasted</del> wisely used a lot of company time. Here are a few of my favorite episodes.</p>
