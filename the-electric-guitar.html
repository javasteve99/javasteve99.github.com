	<p>&ldquo;The Electric Guitar&rdquo; is a presentation created for a semester-long project on Flash. The purpose of the class was to complete the semester with one cohesive presentation/website that would educate the user on a specific topic. The project was required to have an animated intro, a timeline or history of the topic, an interactive quiz that would test the user on their knowledge, and a section for crediting sources.</p>
