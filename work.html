        <p><em>I'll be adding work here soon. Much of my best work is under NDA or other contract. I can share details privately, but not post publicly. You can also get a sense of what I've done by looking at my <a href="https://github.com/javasteve99">Github profile</a>, some visual/UI work on <a href="http://dribbble.com/stevehickeydesign">Dribbble</a>, and my presentations on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/javasteve99">Speakerdeck</a>.</em></p>
