        <p><em>As of late January 2018 I am in the process of adding new work every few days to this page. Much of my best work is under NDA or other contract, but I can share details privately and I'm posting additional work as I finish anonymizing it. You can also get a sense of what I've done by looking at my <a href="https://github.com/javasteve99">Github profile</a>, some visual/UI work on <a href="http://dribbble.com/stevehickeydesign">Dribbble</a>, and my presentations on <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/javasteve99">Speakerdeck</a>.</em></p>
