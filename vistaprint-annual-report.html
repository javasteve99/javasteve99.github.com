  <p>The goal with the 2010 Vistaprint Annual Report was to design something simpler and more understated than past years. After successfully navigating an economic recession we decided that a more frugal approach would appropriately reflect to investors our effort to put our focus back on business basics for the fiscal year.</p>
  <p>We kept existing brand elements such as our font, colors and the &ldquo;wave&rdquo; introduced with our rebranding from the year before, but kept it down to two colors, plus some very light gray and lots of white space.</p>

  <p>A consistent element from past reports was the world map used to indicate our status as a global company. My feeling was that it really wasn&rsquo;t serving any meaningful purpose, so I chose to highlight only the countries in which we operate. There was some feedback that this made us look like a small company, but the CEO agreed with my assessment that it looked more like we were highlighting our potential for expansion and growth.</p>

  <p>Finally, I simplified the charts highlighting our key financial metrics. In past years there were 3-dimensional effects applied to the bars and depth effects applied to the graph background. I chose to remove these in order to clarify the data itself.</p>
  <p>This project only included the inside and outside covers of the report. The inside pages were put together and structured by the finance team.
