  <p>My first major project at <a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/" target="_blank">thoughtbot</a> was to design a site for Boston.io, an annual conference for design and development students interested in working at startups.</p>
  <p>This was the conference&rsquo;s second year. Previously, it had been known as D8, but thoughtbot had acquired a new domain for it and wanted to call it Boston.io from now on. This left me with a pretty blank slate to work with.</p>
  <p>With feedback from thoughtbot&rsquo;s design team I eventually settled on an approach that would call out the city as a main design element, and would use the idea of social proof to persuade students to sign up. By presenting them with a view of some of the students who had already signed up on the home page we hoped to persuade other students that they wanted to attend as well.</p>
