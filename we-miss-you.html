	<p>Copywriter Matina Dafoulas and I were tasked with creating an email campaign that would be sent to customers that had not opened one of our emails in the last year. These 'inactive' customers represented a large opportunity if we could figure out how to engage them. We decided that if we attempted to put a human face on the company we might be able to bring some of them back in. We took photos of actual employees and put them in the email. I intentionally didn't gloss the photos up in order to subtly enforce that they were legitimate.</p>
	<p>By taking this approach and showcasing new products and new offers we were able to increase open rates, click-through rates and conversions.</p>
