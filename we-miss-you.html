      <h2>'we miss you' campaign</h2>
      <img src="images/we-miss-you-01.jpg" />
      <p>Copywriter Matina Dafoulas and I were tasked with creating an email campaign that would be sent to customers that had not opened one of our emails in the last year. These 'inactive' customers represented a large opportunity if we could figure out how to engage them. We decided that if we attempted to put a human face on the company we might be able to bring some of them back in. We took photos of actual employees and put them in the email. I intentionally didn't gloss the photos up in order to subtly enforce that they were legitimate.</p>
      <p>By taking this approach and showcasing new products and new offers we were able to increase open rates, click-through rates and conversions.</p>
      <p>You can view the coded HTML versions of <a href="we-miss-you/WeMissYou-Inactive-1.html" target="_blank">email 1</a>, <a href="we-miss-you/WeMissYou-Inactive-2.html" target="_blank">email 2</a> and <a href="we-miss-you/WeMissYou-Inactive-3-20.html" target="_blank">email 3</a> in a new tab/window.</p>
