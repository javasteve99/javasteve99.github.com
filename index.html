        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Originally trained in print design, I became fascinated with the web during my final year in the visual design program at UMass Dartmouth. Over the next few years I made my way into product/UX and now I work at <a href="https://robinpowered.com/">Robin Powered</a>, leading our product design team in the quest to make using the office a better experience.</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m also the former Director of Fresh Tilled Soil&rsquo;s user experience apprenticeship program <a href="https://www.freshtilledsoil.com/aux/">(AUX)</a>, as well as an occasional <a href="/blog">writer</a> and <a href="/speaking">conference speaker</a>, and a former <a href="/podcast">podcast co-host</a>.</p>
        <p>During the day I&rsquo;m a meticulous craftsman, a full-on typography nerd, and a relentless seeker of problems worth solving. After hours I cook for my family, slowly replace/improve every piece of our home, practice basic woodworking and carpentry, camp and hike, play the guitar, and share the joys of Star Wars and LEGO with our 6-year old son.</p>
