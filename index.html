        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Originally trained in print design, I became fascinated with the web during my final year in the visual design program at UMass Dartmouth. Over the next few years I made my way into product/UX and now I work at <a href="https://www.rocketinsights.com/">Rocket Insights</a> a full-service product agency in Boston, MA.</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m also the former Director of the user experience apprenticeship program <a href="http://aux.freshtilledsoil.com/">AUX</a>, as well as a <a href="/blog">writer</a> and <a href="/speaking">conference speaker</a>, and a former <a href="/podcast">podcast co-host</a>.</p>
        <p>During the day I&rsquo;m a meticulous craftsman, a full-on typography nerd, and a relentless seeker of problems worth solving. After hours I cook for my family, slowly replace/improve every piece of our home, practice basic woodworking and carpentry, camp and hike, and share the joys of <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/KKV8tAM8mLo53sB27">Star Wars and LEGO</a> with our 4-year old son.</p>
