    <p>I&rsquo;m a UX strategist and a product design educator, with a no-nonsense approach to building things that matter.</p>
    <p>Originally trained in print design, I became fascinated with the web during my final year in the visual design program at UMass Dartmouth. Now I work with <a href="http://freshtilledsoil.com">Fresh Tilled Soil</a> in Watertown, MA where I lead teams that <a href="/work">build products</a> for companies that put their users first. I&rsquo;m the Director of <a href="http://aux.freshtilledsoil.com/">AUX</a>, our user experience apprenticeship program, as well as a <a href="/blog">writer</a> and <a href="/speaking">conference speaker</a>, and former <a href="/podcast">podcast co-host</a>.</p>
    <p>During the day I&rsquo;m a meticulous craftsman, the company typography nerd, and a relentless seeker of good challenges. After hours I&rsquo;m a craft beer aficionado and brewer, an aspiring handyman, and an unapologetic Star Wars fan. </p>
