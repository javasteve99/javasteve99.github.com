	<h2>Hi there.</h2>
	<p>My name is Steve Hickey and I'm a Boston-area web designer/developer. In my work I strive for a clean and classic design aesthetic, semantic and well-structured code, and an exceptional user-experience.</p>
	<p>If you're looking for a new website or for a redesign of your existing website please contact me. I'm always looking for new and interesting freelance projects.</p>
