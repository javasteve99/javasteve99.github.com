        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>As Head of Product Design at Robin, I lead the team shaping how organizations interact with workplace technology through AI-assisted experiences that simplify coordination, planning, and space management. My work blends product strategy, system design, and team leadership, ensuring that as AI grows more capable, the products we build remain deeply human.</p>
        <p>My background spans nearly 20 years across design, UX, and product strategy, from hands-on design systems work to managing multidisciplinary teams. I&rsquo;ve led initiatives for complex enterprise tools, run product lines from strategy to delivery, and built design orgs that scale quality and impact through shared principles rather than rigid processes.</p>
        <p>I&rsquo;m particularly interested in how design leadership can guide companies through the Human–AI transition: balancing automation and augmentation, data and judgment, consistency and creativity.</p>
        <p>Outside of work, I’m a typography nerd, a musician, and a dad teaching my son the joys of LEGO, Star Wars, and how to fix (or overcomplicate) things around the house.</p>
