        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Originally trained in print design, I became fascinated with the web during my final year in the visual design program at UMass Dartmouth. Now I work with <a href="http://www.eastcoastproduct.com/">East Coast Product</a> in Boston, MA where I lead the Product Design team and build experiences for companies that understand success comes from putting their users first. I&rsquo;m also the former Director of <a href="http://aux.freshtilledsoil.com/">AUX</a>, a user experience apprenticeship program, as well as a <a href="/blog">writer</a> and <a href="/speaking">conference speaker</a>, and a former <a href="/podcast">podcast co-host</a>.</p>
        <p>During the day I&rsquo;m a meticulous craftsman, the company typography nerd, and a relentless seeker of problems worth solving. After hours I&rsquo;m a craft beer aficionado and brewer, aspiring handyman, and unapologetic Star Wars fan. </p>
